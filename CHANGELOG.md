# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and
this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
Patch releases (`v1.7.X`) carry non-breaking bug fixes and minor features;
minor releases (`v1.X`) carry breaking changes, major features, and expanded
MCP protocol version support; a major release (`v2`) will align with a
corresponding `v2` in the wider MCP SDK ecosystem. See
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full versioning policy.

This file was introduced during the v1.7.x series. Structured entries below cover
**v1.6.0 and later**; earlier releases can be reviewed via the
[Git tag history](https://github.com/logiscape/mcp-sdk-php/tags).

## [1.7.1]

### Added

- Repository-level governance and process documentation: CONTRIBUTING,
  CODE_OF_CONDUCT, SECURITY, SUPPORT, GOVERNANCE, ROADMAP, CHANGELOG.
- Issue and pull request templates under `.github/`.
- Expanded documentation under `docs/` (compatibility, dependency policy,
  labels, testing) and `conformance/README.md`.
- GitHub action for official MCP conformance tests
- GitHub action for unit tests and PHPStan

### Removed

- Removed Chinese language README, it was a community contribution and we
  cannot currently verify an updated translation would be accurate.

## [1.7.0]

Targets MCP spec revision `2025-11-25`. Expands client-side auth back-compat,
adds server-initiated sampling, and broadens SSE streaming support on both sides
of the wire. Conformance: 100% of applicable required tests pass against suite
`v0.1.16`; three known failures remain in optional MCP Extensions (see
[`conformance/conformance-baseline.yml`](conformance/conformance-baseline.yml)).

### Added

- Full MCP conformance test suite integration (`composer conformance`,
  `composer conformance-server`, `composer conformance-client`) with a
  pinned tool version in `package.json`.
- Server-initiated sampling.
- Server-side SSE elicitation and progress notifications.
- Client-side elicitation handler groundwork and elicitation defaults.
- Client-side SSE retry and improved cURL failure tolerance.
- Client-side back-compat for the `2025-03-26` auth flow.
- Optional `inputSchema` parameter for tool registration.
- DNS rebinding protection on the HTTP server transport.
- Alignment with SEP-1699 on the client.
- Preservation of tool-call metadata to support future progress-notification
  plumbing.
- Additional client-side auth conformance coverage.

### Changed

- HTTP server transport streaming and protocol handling refined.
- Webclient example updated to align with the current SDK client, and the
  automatic GET SSE stream is now disabled by default inside the webclient
  wrapper for broader shared-hosting compatibility.

### Fixed

- HTTP client SSE behavior on PHP 8.1.
- Cross-feature result carry-over across HTTP suspend/resume transitions.
- Unit test output noise.
- Correct sample field name for the `elicitation-sep1330-enums` scenario.
- SSE streaming parser bug.
- HTTP origin allowlist normalization.

## [1.6.1]

### Fixed

- `ElicitationCreateResult` return type corrected.

### Changed

- README and `AGENTS.md` refreshed.

## [1.6.0]

### Added

- Elicitation support
- Ability to set the MCP server version explicitly
  ([#58](https://github.com/logiscape/mcp-sdk-php/pull/58), contributed by
  [@vjik](https://github.com/vjik)).

### Changed

- Server developer documentation updated to cover elicitation.
- Removed the unnecessary `enableElicitation` gate method.

### Fixed

- Experimental task features no longer interfere with elicitation requests.
- `_elicitationResults` is now correctly forwarded on HTTP resume.

### Removed

- Dead code cleanup.
